### Capstone: Addressing Fairness Issues in Imbalanced Datasets
- Description: Addressing bias issues in imbalanced datasets, like credit card fraud detection, is crucial for developing fair and accurate machine learning models. One approach to mitigating bias involves leveraging Universum data in Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. In this project, we will incorporate Universum data into the training process so that SVM models can learn a more nuanced decision boundary that better generalizes across both classes, reducing the impact of bias. Students interested in this project would implement several related SVM models to interesting applications like disease detection where number of positive results are significantly lower than negative results.
